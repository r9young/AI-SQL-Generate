Step of doing it:

1. Create a new app: `ng new openai-sql-app`


2. `ng generate component`: ng generate component sql-prompt

    - generate a new Angular component named sql-prompt


3. `ng generate service`: ng geenerate service sql-prompt

    - generate a new Angular service name sql-prompt


So what is different between component and service in Angular?

- component:A component is the building block of Augular UI, it controls a specific part of user interface. 

- service: e.g A service is used to fetch data from a backend logic that needs to be shared across multiple component

so Component  = UI (Frontend) and Service = Logic (Backend Code-like)
